            p:' I challenged myself: "Can you do it?" And I got enrolled to the course after diligently making all test assignments. Not only do the Kottans explain the basics and repeat it a number of times to make material completely clear, but they also help to train self-organization very well (personally, my level has risen). And this is a big family - there is always support in chat rooms (if you’re stuck), informal outdoor parties, etc.'

Not after the first interview (you need to acquire some experience points in passing the interviews), but a housewife (with a long experience) without formal education started to work as a Junior front-end developer in the Ministry of Finance (and coded not only HTML & CSS but did proper JS tasks).'

The work was truly hard, and it will remain hard in the future. However if you progress at least in baby steps and with every step become better than your previous self, it\'s worth it.'

But time passed, and no particular experience or knowledge appeared) because the right time is here and now. Until you try, you do not know what you really are capable of and in what direction you want to go. Kottans offer not only cool courses, but it’s also a community, it\'s a whole subculture. There is no such thing as a dumb question here. Here you can both study and teach others, each time discovering new nuances of seemingly clear things.'

They are people you respect, admire and on which you really want to be like, when you grow up)) Who else would explain seemingly obvious things to an unknown person several times without losing self-control? :) Things like this are very motivating. It\'s awesome to learn from those who believe that quality knowledge is not a business, but a way to make the IT industry well developed, more successful and productive. You are cool, Kottans! Thank you!'

After a month of such studies, I realized that I was clearly lacking the basics. And then I came across the announcement of an online course from Kottans. I took a look at the program - it was just what was needed. And I think that is what all beginners need.'

Live communication from the very beginning of the online course with pull-requests and reviews, an absolutely unique experience that is difficult to obtain even on paid resources. By the way, the lack of a fee in itself is amazing in our time, and at the same time guarantees the transparency of motivation of mentors - they want to help people, and therefore the reviews were as detailed and qualitative as possible. the course left only positive impressions. In addition, I got the opportunity to contribute to community life, which is invaluable in principle.'

When I joined the course, I was already working as a frontend developer knowing HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript basics, but I knew I wanted to have a more solid understanding of modern approaches to JavaScript development. I am grateful to mentors and active students for their high professionalism and contribution to such a cool community, for their positive attitude, openness, valuable advice and enthusiasm! Personally, I was waiting for the next class not only to get a new batch of knowledge but also to hang out after class))) During the training, we tried to contribute to various initiatives of the Kottans: social network postings, mutual assistance, help to students from the p2p course and so on.'

To our team-lead and mentor Oleksiy Rudenko great respect for the fact that he wonderfully led the whole process and was an example for us! In my opinion, communities like this one help to change our country for the better! After all, mutual assistance, communication, and cooperation are the keys to success! I am proud to be a Kottan! And I feel that after the courses I became more professional in my field, and also contributed something useful to this community!'

You need to work on yourself and your self-organization. But if you still decide to change your life, then you definitely need to go to Kottans. Only modern technology stack, working programmers as mentors, not one, two, but many, and many of them will always answer your questions. And most importantly, there is no such thing as a stupid question here. I am very glad that I joined them and became a part of a big family.'
